# Andre Nuernberg Pavan
<sub>*Petroleum Engineering studant* at University of Santa Catarina State </sub>

Student of the last period of petroleum engineering at the University of the State of Santa Catarina.

I have already participated in a research project at CNPq, where, through programming in C/C++, we created a fluid simulator with high Reynolds numbers in porous media.

Since then I fell in love with programming, so I started to learn more about Python, where I discovered the world of data, and so now I'm focused on learning Data Science.

I'm taking the Data Science course by Carlos Melo, from Sigmoidal, and I'll leave the projects in this repository during my learning journey.
**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Petroleum Engineering and Data Science.
